# Bearings
**Journal** and **roller bearings** allows the connection of 2 members leaving free 1 degree of motion (the rotation along a axis) minimizing as much as possible the friction. For particular configuration also exists **linear guides** allowing axial motion.

# Journal Bearings
A journal bearing is a turning pair where a cylindrical body, the **journal**, rotates with clearance inside a cylindrical cavity, the **bearing**; for good operation of absolute importance is the presence of proper **lubricant** in the _meatus_ (the space between the surfaces).

Journal bearings are classified according to
- the type of the load that can be **radial**, **axial** (usually referred as _thrust_) or a combination of both;
- the **lubrication regime** that can either be dry (no lubricant), mixed, hydrodynamic or hydrostatic;
- the **material** that can either be metallic or non-metallic.

## Lubrication regimes
The **friction** of the bearing is described in the **Stribeck diagrams** as function of the angular rotation $n \ [rpm]$ as well as the lubrican viscosity $\nu$ and the applied pressure load $p_l = \frac F{bd}$; another important parameter is the radial clearance $C_r = R-r$ (where $R$ is the radius of the bearing while $r$ the radius of the journal).

Depending on the position on the Stribeck diagram we can be in one of this conditions:
1. dry friction or boundary lubrication: the lubricant film is not thick enough to create a full film. We have the highest friction coefficients $f \in [0.05, 0.2]$;
1. mixed lubrication: the lubricant film is not stable in time but we still achieve a friction reduction in the range $f \in [0.004, 0.1]$;
1. full film or fluid lubrication: the surfaces are separated by a _thick enough_ lubricant film under pressure, reducing to the minimum the friction $f \in [0.002, 0.01]$.

To define the lubrication regime we can exploit the **Sommerfeld number** defined as
$$S_o = \left( \frac r{C_r}\right)^2 \frac{\nu n}{p_l} $$

The main 4 types of journal bearings are:
1. **dry lubrication** usually made by non-metal (such teflon) or bronze material; there's no lubrication but are characterized by having lowest price;
1. **boundary** or **mixed lubrication**: it's the most common type of journal bearing and uses oil-soaked porus material (such olite) to fill the meatus;
1. **fluid** or **hydrodynamic lubrication** that's suitable for heavy loads at high rotational speeds: the journal is supported by the high pressure arising by the rotation;
1. **hydrostatic lubrication**: the lubricant at high pressure generates a thick film; the fluid pressure is generated by an external source, thus this system is good for machines requiring frequent motion reversal and lower startup friction.

## Bearing design and verification
### Bearing overload
By analysing the jorunal (subjected to the lubricant pressure $p_l$ for the lower half), then by computing a static relation we have
$$F=\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} p\cos(\theta) br \, d\theta \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad p_l = \frac F{bd} \leq p_{all} $$
This equation can be rewritten to explicitly have a relation for the journal diameter $d$ as function of the applied radial load $F$, the allowable pressure $p_{all}$ and the journal ratio $b/d$ as
$$d^3 \leq \sqrt{\frac{F}{p_{all}\frac bd}} $$
In the design we usually choose $b/d \in [0.5, 1.5]$.

### Bearing overheating
We also need to consider the power balance between the friction heating (power $W_f$) and the heat exchanged by the surroundings $W_\alpha$ and the heat exchanged due to the oil flow $W_o$.

The power loss due to friction is modelled as
$$W_f = T_f \omega = f F \frac d2 \omega = fFv = f p_l bd v $$

The heat transferred through the surroundings can be regarded as $W_\alpha = \alpha A \big( T_{oil}-T_{amb}\big)$, where $A$ is the exchange area and $\alpha \backsim 11-35 W \cdot m^{-1} \cdot K^{-1}$ is the heat coefficient.

The heat transferred due to the volumetric oil flow $Q$ of a lubricant with density $\rho$ and thermal capacity $C_p$ is 
$$ W_o = Q \rho C_p \big(T_{out} - T_{in} \big) $$

Usually this last term is negligible, thus we have to equate $W_f$ with $W_\alpha$. Solving $\alpha \pi db\big(T_{oil} - T_{amb}\big) = fp_l bdv$ gives us that
$$\big(T_{oil}-T_{amb}\big) = \frac f{\pi \alpha} p_l v \leq \Delta T_{all} $$
Having a limited allowed temperature difference, but the only parameter not known at catalogue are $p_l$ and $v$, the standard verification at overheating is performed as
$$p_lv \leq \big(p_l v\big)_{all} $$
